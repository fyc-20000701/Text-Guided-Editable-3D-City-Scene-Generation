In a large metropolitan area, there is a central lake surrounded by a ring of commercial buildings. Beyond the commercial area lies a dense forest to the north and a residential zone to the south. To the east of the lake, there is a recreational park with a stadium in the center. Roads connect all the areas seamlessly.
